# FCE_Handbook
This is a Dump of the Whole FCE Handbook entries.
You are welcomed to add/change the entries you feel are lacking information quality.

If you want to work in your local file system first:
Rightclick on the FCE entry in your Steam libary
Select "Properties"
open the "Local Files" Tab
Select "Browse Local Files"
Open either the 32 or 64 folder depending on your Computer (if youre not sure, try 64 first.
Then navigate to "Default\Handbook" in there you will see all the Entries sorted in the same Categories as in this repository.

Modify the File/Files you want to work on. To not have to restart the game after each edit, you can open the ingame console with the ' key. (most liekly the one two left of the Backspace key, youll have to try around).
in the console enter the command "reloadbook" (without the ""). Your game will freezeup for a short time while the entries are reloaded. 
After that, open the Handbook again and check your Edit.


IMPORTANT: 
NO NUMBERS, as in no number which change in difficulties. Like Power generated, Ores per bar.
Keep it simple without the need of a calculator with ratios mentioned all over.
